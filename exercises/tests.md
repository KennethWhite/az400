# Tests and test results

## Setup
Exercises below will use a Coalesce gnerated app. What the app does is not important it is only used to demonstrate the concepts.

If you already have an application deployed that can be used you can save yourself some time. However, we do want to keep the solution small in order to focus on the testing topic.

## Unit Tests
- Small, fast, cheap to execute
- do not require a deployed environment

1. E

## Integration Tests
Hit api endpoints that exercise 

## Functional Tests
Playwright
Executing manual tests with Azure Tests
